This is a command line util to hash the exported symbol names of a given Mach-O binary or library.

You can modify the hashing algorithm by modifying the hash_string() function at hashing.c.
The default hash is the one used by OS.X/Crisis malware.

It is able to process non-fat and fat binaries. For now it supports x86, x86_64, ARM binaries.

By default it will write a text file with format "target_name_arch_hashex.txt", which can be used by the
IDC scripts available at https://github.com/gdbinit/Crisis-Analysis-Tools.

The output folder is the current directory.
If target is a fat binary you can extract only a single arch using the -a option.

It's also possible to hash a single symbol by using the -s option. Don't forget you need to input
the symbol name with the leading underscore.

Bug reports, fixes and patches are welcome: reverser@put.as 
or https://github.com/gdbinit/Crisis-Analysis-Tools

That's it! Enjoy :-)

fG!
